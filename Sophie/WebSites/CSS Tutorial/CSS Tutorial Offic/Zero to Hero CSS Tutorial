Selectors: from least specific to most specific

YOU CAN ADD MULTIPLE CLASSES SEPERATED BY A SPACE
EXAMPLE:
<a class= subtitle subtitle-subtitle></a>
BOTH ARE DIFFERENT CLASSES BUT BELONG TO SAME A
very small number of attributes

            CSS FORMAT
        selector {
            property: value;
            property2: value2;
        }


(IN LINE (html) STYLE IN THE HTML OVERRIDES ALL OTHER SELECTORS)

Element Selector
- You can select entire elements without any special characters.
- This applies to all the elements with that tag on the page.
- It ranks on the bottom of the specificity scale.\

Class Selector
- This is used to select elements with a certain class name.
- can be used on any and all elements with that class.
- Can be used multiple times, and is select with . (PERIOD) symbol.

ID Selector
- This can be used to select elements with a certain ID name.
- Can be used on any and all elements with that ID
- unlike classes, it can only be used on one element at a time, and is selected with the #  symbol. However, it is possible to use more than once.


Html: 
<td> a table
<a> tag that gives link to websites
example:
<a href ="http://www.google.com">Click here to go to Google</a>
<textarea> box where you input text ()
<ul> unordered list (typically a parent)
<li> listed item (typically a child)
<ol> ordered list (parent"basically ul with bullet points"(ordered))


            CSS:

Color: changes color of selecter id, class, element, etc
Border: Adds border around selected item
Background: adds background to selected item
list-style-position: inside; Allows bullet points to be apart of li


            Psuedo Selectors:

Very specific Selectors that is added after a (element, class, id) selector
examples:
- h2:hover {
    color: red; CHANGES COLOR WHEN MOUSE HOVERS OVER TEXT
}

- Another psuedo selector is First Child and Last Child / nth child(#)
- PARENT CHILD EXAMPLE :
<ul> (parent)
    <li></li>(first child)
</ul>
Css:
li:first-child {
    color:steelblue; (first child is the color of steelblue)
}
li:nth-child(1) {
    color:steelblue; (first child is the color of steelblue)
}

- APPLIES TO ALL ONLYCHILDREN
li:only-child {
    color: purple;
}

- Link/visited

- ELEMENTS
DIFFERENT PARENT
 h2 + a {
    color:red; (turns <a> red that is after the element <h2>)
}

SAME PARENT
textarea(box where u input text/example: login input) ~ button {
    color:purple; (every button after text area turns purple.)
}
every a tag that follows an h2 turns the color red.

Parent - Child 
Every single child in particular parent follows '''
ul > li {
    color: purple;
}
every li in ul is the color of purple


            - ATTRIBUTES

can select certain things in the code based off of their attributes
- element[attr=value]{

}
- example
h2[class=subtitles]{

}

- can select images
img[src=""]{
    (SPECIFIC IMAGE)
}
- can select multiple images
if img ends with ../img/
img[src^="../img/"]{

}
if img contains /img/
img[src*="../img/"]{

}

            - DIFFERENT WAY 
example:
h2[class~=article-subtitle]{
    background:green;
}

- Exception
example:
h2[class|=article-subtitle]{
    (finds either every article-subtitle in h2 or every article-subtitle with a dash)
}
